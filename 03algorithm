VARNAM STEMMER


1. Compile the scheme file and insert values into stemrules table

2. buffer = empty_string_bufer

3. Do not stem if size of word is less than 10 bytes. (Min_stem_size)

4. While (termination_condition() is not met)

	4.1 Get last letter of the word and insert it at the beginning of the buffer

	4.2 if buffer is in level1
		4.2.1 apply stemrule from level1, word is modified
		4.2.2 if(independent_existence)
			4.2.2.1 learn word
		4.2.3 clear buffer

	4.3 else if buffer is in level2
		4.3.1 apply stemrule from level2, word is modified
		4.3.2 if(independent_existence)
			4.3.2.1 learn word
		4.3.3 clear buffer

    4.4 else if buffer is in level3
 		4.4.1 apply stemrule from level3, word is modified
 		4.4.2 if(independent_existence)
 			4.4.2.1 learn word
 		4.4.3 clear buffer

 	4.5 else
 		4.5.1 break

5. Learn the stemmed word


TERMINATION CONDITION
1. Return true if :
	a) The word ends with ം
	b) If the word ends with a consonant and there is no added swara eg : പരീക്ഷ (pareeksha)
	c) If the buffer contains the rest of the word (or whole of it)


INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE:

If the word can be stemmed further but the current intermediate form has an independent existence, learn it.
Eg: മരത്തിലൂടെ would stem to മരത്തിലൂ in step 1 and then to മരത്തിൽ.
upon detecting that മരത്തിൽ has an independent existence, varnam should learn it and then continue stemming.
